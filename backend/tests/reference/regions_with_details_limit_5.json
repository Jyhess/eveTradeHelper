    "description": "The Derelik region, sovereign seat of the Ammatar Mandate, became the shield to the Amarrian flank in the wake of the Minmatar Rebellion. Derelik witnessed many hostile exchanges between the Amarr and rebel forces as the latter tried to push deeper into the territory of their former masters. Having held their ground, thanks in no small part to the Ammatars' military efforts, the Amarr awarded the Ammatar with their own province. However, this portion of space shared borders with the newly forming Minmatar Republic as well as the Empire, and thus came to be situated in a dark recess surrounded by hostiles. \n\nGiven the lack of safe routes elsewhere, the local economies of this region were dependent on trade with the Amarr as their primary means of survival. The Ammatar persevered over many decades of economic stagnation and limited trade partners, and their determination has in recent decades been rewarded with an increase in economic prosperity. This harsh trail is a point of pride for all who call themselves Ammatar, and it has bolstered their faith in the Amarrian way to no end.",

    "description": "A sprawling region in the galactic \"north,\" the Vale of the Silent has a reputation as one of the most foreboding regions in the cluster. The Guristas pirates who prowl the area, scavenging for resources, do little to dispel the notion that the Vale is a haunted relic of times past. Rumors of secret Jovian experiments in the area abound, though no one has ever given proof of such things. The region is one of the closest areas to Jovian space, despite no longer having any functioning stargates leading there. Many of the other Empires have made attempts to set up spying stations in an attempt to probe out Jovian secrets, but none have lasted long in the harsh area. Now, the area is left totally to capsuleer control and they have proven hardier than those who came before them.",

    "description": "In the outer reaches of the south, nestled behind its formidable neighbors, lies Detorid. This unassuming region is home to what have become termed dead storms, a phenomenon thus far not found anywhere else. They appear randomly, centered around certain planets, ravage the area for days, then abruptly vanish.\r\n\r\nScientists have had relatively few chances to travel to the region to study dead storms, as Detorid once marked the edge of the Jove Empire and now lies within the Angel Cartel's territory. Current theory points to the storms being tears in the fabric of space. Why they exist in the first place, or the reason for their being focused around certain planets, remain mysteries and will no doubt do so for some time yet.",
